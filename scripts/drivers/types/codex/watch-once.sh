# One-shot pending-message oracle for the Codex app-server bridge.
#
# Usage:
#   watch-once.sh <project_path> <agent_type> [--name <agent>] [--team <team>] [--owner <owner>] [--timeout <sec>] [--interval <sec>]
#
# Exits:
#   0  unread inbound exists for the subscription
#   1  configuration or runtime error
#   2  timeout with no unread inbound
#
# This script does not maintain a watermark and never marks messages as read.
# `inbox.sh` remains the only read cursor; watch-once simply waits until the
# inbox cursor says there is something to handle.

# Taken before any startup work, because the deadline below has to bound this
# process's LIFETIME, not just its polling. The bridge force-kills the child at
# (timeout + interval + 10) seconds measured from spawn (codex-bridge.js,
# process/spawn timeoutMs), so a deadline computed after startup makes the real
# wall time startup + TIMEOUT. Where startup is slower than interval + 10 — MSYS
# fork emulation measured at 55-300ms per spawn puts a Windows host at ~29s — the
# bridge kills the child before it can reach its own deadline, so it exits 124
# instead of the clean 2 on every single re-arm, the bridge counts three failures
# and self-destructs, and the launcher restarts it forever. Reported with
# measurements by 東リ屋 (#558). Startup on Linux is ~0.2s, which is why this has
# never surfaced here.
#
# Making the deadline lifetime-based means a slow startup eats into the polling
# window rather than overrunning the ceiling. It cannot skip the inbox check
# entirely: the loop queries before it tests the deadline, so even a deadline
# that is already past yields one full check first.
