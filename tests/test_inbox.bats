# --- check-inbox.sh ------------------------------------------------------

# What the hook runtimes actually do with a Stop-hook run, applied to a real
# invocation of check-inbox.sh.
#
# The contract is theirs, not ours: as DOCUMENTED, stdout is read as control
# JSON only when the process exits 0, and a non-zero exit is logged as a hook
# failure with the output discarded. Measured on Claude Code 2.1.226 it was
# processed on exit 0, 1, 2 and 3 alike (#658), so the two disagree — and this
# helper models the documented rule deliberately, because a helper that assumed
# the laxer observed behaviour would stop catching the defect on any runtime
# that follows the document. Asserting on the shell's stdout alone cannot see
# either: the first attempt at this fix emitted the messages and then exited
# non-zero, so it was inert on the only path that was broken while its tests
# passed.
#
# The parse is part of the contract too. Returning raw stdout would stay green
# for malformed JSON, for a payload under some other key, or for text outside
# `reason` — none of which an operator would ever see. So this parses, requires
# `decision` to be `block`, and returns ONLY `reason`: exactly the bytes the
# runtime puts in front of a person.
