# #1262/#1318: record <pid> (a process this test just backgrounded with `&`)
# so teardown can kill+wait it even if the test body aborts, at some later
# assertion, before its own cleanup ever runs. Call this immediately after
# every `... &`. File-backed rather than a bash array: several tests
# background more than one process across more than one statement, and a
# file needs no separate declare/reset per test -- setup_test_env's fresh
# TEST_SKILL_DIR is already a clean per-test slate, removed with everything
# else at teardown.
#
# This covers what _reap_test_skill_dir_procs (below) cannot: a `sleep 600`
# started as a stand-in session pid (see e.g. "watch: two sessions sharing a
# session_id keep independent watchers") carries no TEST_SKILL_DIR in its
# argv at all -- `sleep 600` names nothing about this test -- so the
# argv-scoped reap has nothing to match it on. Tracking the pid directly
# closes that gap regardless of what the backgrounded command's own argv
# does or does not contain (review finding, #1451).
#
# Records $BASHPID alongside <pid> -- the pid of THIS exact process, captured
# at the moment of the call, which is unambiguously the backgrounded job's
# real parent (a plain function call forks nothing, so _bg_track always runs
# in the same process that just executed the `&` immediately before it).
# teardown re-checks this recorded parent against the pid's CURRENT actual
# parent before ever touching it (see _bg_reap_tracked) -- many tests already
# kill+wait their own pid inside the test body before reaching teardown, and
# once `wait` reaps a pid the OS is free to recycle that number for an
# unrelated process, possibly another test's or a real seat's. A bare `kill`
# cannot tell a live-but-reassigned pid from the one this test actually
# started, so recording (and later re-verifying) the parent is what makes it
# safe to kill by pid at all (review finding, #1451).

  # #1262/#1318: several tests below start a watch.sh (or a `sleep 600`
  # stand-in session pid) in the background, then assert on its output or

  # command -- so whenever one of those assertions fails, the kill/wait
  # written after it never runs, and the process is orphaned (reproduced
  # directly: forcing one such assertion to fail left its watcher running
  # past the test's own end, every time, before this teardown hook existed).
  # Reordering each such test to kill before asserting would only fix
  # today's sites and leave the same gap for the next test that backgrounds
  # a process. Reaping HERE instead closes it for every test in this file,
  # present or future, whether or not its own body ever reaches its own
  # kill/wait -- an in-body kill/wait some tests still do is harmless,
  # ordinary idempotent cleanup once this also runs.

  #   - _bg_reap_tracked (above): the pids this test itself recorded via

  #     whose argv names nothing about this test.
  #   - _reap_test_skill_dir_procs (test_helper.bash, shared with every
  #     other suite): scoped to processes whose argv names THIS test's own
  #     TEST_SKILL_DIR -- a unique mktemp path -- so it can only ever reach
  #     a process this test itself started; it cannot reach another test's
  #     watcher or a real seat's (see its own header for why this scoping is
  #     safe). Kept as a backstop for anything a future test backgrounds
  #     without going through _bg_track.
  # All three statuses are propagated (not swallowed) so a process that
  # somehow survives even SIGKILL escalation fails the test loudly instead
  # of silently leaking, same as a real seat's monitor never should.

# A wait that times out returns non-zero HERE, so the failure names the condition
