# --- #1140/#1152: team never creates a placement record --------------------------
# Retained, not deleted, though it was buried in the #1110 repair block: review
# caught that this one is a READ-ONLY safety property, not a --fix behaviour,
# and had no equivalent surviving anywhere else (checked by grep across
# team-status.sh, which only has the CREATE side of this, not the refusal).
# team.sh is now purely read-only, which makes "it never writes a record" more
# load-bearing than it was, not less.
#
# Confirmed non-vacuous both ways, on the pre-removal tree: with --fix present,
# the SAME fixture's paired test showed record creation actually happening
# (`team --fix creates a socket-qualified tmux record from the label`, deleted
# alongside --fix itself); and removing the FIX==1 gate on the create-from-label
# call reddened this exact assertion. This is not "nothing can create a record
# because the code is gone" read back as a test -- it is the property that was
# already true, and now must stay true with no flag standing behind it.
